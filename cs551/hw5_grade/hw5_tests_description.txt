# Tests performed on cs551 hw5 (tcp)

For each test executing manage, we choose a random port between 10000-32000
After each test, all manage, compute, report are terminated with SIGTERM.
Each test has a fresh version of manage.

a)
Runs manage in the background (&)
Waits 1 sec
Kills manage with SIGINT
Waits 2 secs
Checks if listening port exists with "lsof -u $USER -i -P -n"

b)
Using egrep, checks for "poll", "select", "fork", "threads"

c)
Runs manage in the background (&)
Waits 1 sec
Runs compute in the background (&)
Waits 1 sec
Runs report
Report must show perfect numbers, tests, one compute connected.

d)
Runs manage in the background (&)
Waits 1 sec
Runs compute in the background (&)
Waits 1 sec
loops 5 times
   Waits 2 sec
   Runs report
The sequence of reports must show increasing values of "tested".

e)
Runs manage in the background (&)
Waits 1 sec
Runs compute in the background (&)
Waits 1 sec
Runs report -k
Checks if any instance of manage or compute exists with "ps"

f)
Runs manage in the background (&)
loops 10 times
   Waits 1 sec
   Runs compute in the background (&)
   Waits 1 sec
   Kills the compute with SIGHUP, SIGINT, SIGQUIT alternating
Waits 1 sec
Runs report 
We must obtain the report, manage must be kept rnning, no compute should exist in report or using "ps".

g)
Inspects code to determine if the 15 seconds range goal is implemented.

h)
Runs manage in the background (&)
Waits 1 sec
loops 10 times
   Runs compute in the background (&)
Waits 1 sec
Runs report 
We must see the report of 10 computes connect, manage and 10 computes must be running.

i)
Runs manage in the background (&)
Waits 1 sec
loops with I in range 1..10 (10 times)
   Runs compute in the background (&)
   WAIT = (2^I)/1000 (from 2 to 1000 milliseconds) (^ means power)
   Waits WAIT
   Runs report 
We must be able to see the 10 reports requested with varying time between a new compute started and the report.
